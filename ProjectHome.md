Welcome to the Google Glass APIs issue tracker. If you're writing software that uses the GDK and/or the Mirror API, you've probably found what you're looking for. You can do all of these things here:

  * [Check known issues](https://code.google.com/p/google-glass-api/issues/list)
  * [Report bugs](https://code.google.com/p/google-glass-api/issues/entry) in the API
  * Request [new API features](https://code.google.com/p/google-glass-api/issues/entry?labels=Type-Enhancement)

For everything else, there's probably a better place to go.

  * [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com) is the best place to ask questions:
